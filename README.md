## 🧭 About Me

I’m a machine learning researcher and applied AI engineer with a background in **software engineering** and a strong focus on **deep learning experimentation**, **multi-modal systems**, and **ML-driven applications**. My work sits at the intersection of research and engineering, emphasizing rigorous experimentation, reproducibility, and real-world impact.

I’m currently completing my **Master’s in Applied Computing** at Wilfrid Laurier University, where my research focuses on designing and evaluating **multi-modal deep learning pipelines** using speech, text, and auxiliary features. Previously, I worked at **Autodesk Research**, where I built ML-driven optimization tools for modeling and improving human interaction with architectural spaces.

I’m especially interested in applied ML roles where thoughtful experimentation, system design, and impact matter as much as model performance.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

- **RAG Benchmark Service**  
  Benchmark-driven retrieval system for scientific question answering, built with an evaluation-first workflow (SciFact / BEIR), dual retrieval baselines (BM25 + dense/FAISS), and a production FastAPI service with citation enforcement, monitoring, drift detection, and quality gates.

- **PocketGuide**  
  Domain-adapted language model for structured travel guidance. Built with contracts-first evaluation (fixed prompt suite + objective metrics), synthetic instruction tuning with quality gating, LoRA fine-tuning on Llama-2-7B, and GGUF quantization for offline inference.

- **Personal Portfolio Website**  
  Statically-generated portfolio site built with Next.js App Router + MDX content. Focused on fast load times, content-first workflows, and clean UX patterns (tag system, theming via CSS custom properties, and reusable components).
