## 🧭 About Me

I’m a machine learning researcher and applied AI engineer with a background in **software engineering** and a strong focus on **deep learning experimentation**, **multi-modal systems**, and **ML-driven applications**. My work sits at the intersection of research and engineering, emphasizing rigorous experimentation, reproducibility, and real-world impact.

I’m currently completing my **Master’s in Applied Computing** at Wilfrid Laurier University, where my research focuses on designing and evaluating **multi-modal deep learning pipelines** using speech, text, and auxiliary features. Previously, I worked at **Autodesk Research**, where I built ML-driven optimization tools for modeling and improving human interaction with architectural spaces.

I’m especially interested in applied ML roles where thoughtful experimentation, system design, and impact matter as much as model performance.
